    <p> To get all products type "/api/products" in the URL </p>
    <br>
    <p> To add a product to the shopingcart type "/api/add?" followed by "item=" and then the number of the item.
        *The number is the place of the item object in the response JSON array in the console* </p>
    <br>
    <p> To remove a product from the shopingcart do the exact same as above instructions to add something.
        However, instead of typing "/api/add?" type "/api/remove?" then add the array number of the product
        in your shopingcart list, not the number from the catalogue array!
    </p>
